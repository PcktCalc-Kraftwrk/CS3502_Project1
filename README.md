# About
This project requires Oracle Virtual Box and Debian GNU/Linux 12, although the main version of Ubuntu may be used as a substitute.

This code creates a simulated dockyard where ships enter, drop off their cargo and crewmates, and then refresh their inventory before leaving. It also contains an IPC that shows the pipes connecting the process to one another.

# Program.cs

This file holds the main code.
